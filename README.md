# PushTimer

    This is the newest implementation of Exercise Enforcer (C++).

    It is intended to be a fully OO, portable, extensible solution to the problem of a repeatable, asynchronous, customizable timer with push notification. In other words, the timer should be able to repeat at any interval, the repeating intervals should be variable if desired, the number of repetitions should likewise be variable, and timer should notify the user each time the duration expires.

    I also intend to use TDD to develop this.
